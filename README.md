# NETSTAT
A simple network connection status checker

It was mainly done for my workplace, to test the connection of our equipments in all counties, with results displayed in a html page.

It is a simple project, done with Python3, html, css, and a little bit of Javascript.

Back-end in Django, but I have not added it yet here, it's in the works.
Front-end in plain HTML and CSS with javascript to interact with json objects.

Just a personal project to learn a thing or two.

Python dependecies:
 - configparser
 - icmplib

I will attach an image with a DEMO result.
